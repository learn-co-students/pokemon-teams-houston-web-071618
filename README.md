# Pokemon Teams!

Here you're going to help us keep track of Pokemon
trainers at Flatiron School. Through their journey,
**a Pokemon trainer can only have 6 Pokemon for their
team**. If they want to add another Pokemon, they must
release one of their Pokemon first.

![Showing how the application runs from loading, adding Pokemon to a team and also releasing one](/pokemon-teams-frontend/assets/pokemon_teams.gif)

## Requirements

- When a user loads the page, they should see all
  trainers, with their current team of Pokemon.
- Whenever a user hits `Add Pokemon` and they have
  space on their team, they should get a new Pokemon.
- Whenever a user hits `Release Pokemon` on a specific
  Pokemon team, that specific Pokemon should be released from
  the team.

## Suggested HTML

A Pokemon Card can be placed within the `<main>` tags.

### Pokemon Trainer Card

```
<div class="card" data-id="1"><p>Prince</p>
  <button data-trainer-id="1">Add Pokemon</button>
  <ul>
    <li>Jacey (Kakuna) <button class="release" data-pokemon-id="140">Release</button></li>
    <li>Zachariah (Ditto) <button class="release" data-pokemon-id="141">Release</button></li>
    <li>Mittie (Farfetch'd) <button class="release" data-pokemon-id="149">Release</button></li>
    <li>Rosetta (Eevee) <button class="release" data-pokemon-id="150">Release</button></li>
    <li>Rod (Beedrill) <button class="release" data-pokemon-id="151">Release</button></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## API Routes

You shouldn't need to do anything with the backend as it stands. The documentation
below should show you how to utilize every API endpoint necessary to build the
application. Remember, we need to make sure our Rails backend is setup, migrated,
and is running and making requests through `http://localhost:3000`.

### Getting All Trainers and their Pokemon

```
#=> Example Request
GET /trainers

#=> Example Response
